# NAOMI'S CREATIVE CODING JOURNEY
This is a repository that records the entire learning process and projects in the roadmap to conquer creative coding.

## PROJECT GOALS
* Mastering HTML CSS JS with system-oriented thinking
* Proficient in design principles
* Mastering the GSAP and ScrollTrigger Animation libraries
* Build an Awwwards quality portfolio by the end of the roadmap

## TECH STACK

 **Libraries/Frameworks:** GSAP, Astro.js
 **Tools:** Git & Github (apply Conventional Commits)

## PROJECT STRUCTURE
 **/week-1-review:** Summary exercises of week 1 (Float Grid, Box Model, Position, Gestalt, Hierarchy)
 **/week-2-review:** (to be added)
 ... (The structure will be updated as progress is made)

## WHAT I LEARNED
* **WEEK 1**
    **Git:** established a daily 'commit' and 'push' process, understood the importance of 'git add .' (convenience) vs 'git add <file>' (controlable) and the need for '.gitignore'
    **Box Model:** 'box-sizing: border-box' are required to have a predictable layout and avoid calculation errors
    **Design Principles:** applied The Grid System (12 col),  Visual Hierarchy, Typography, Gestalt, Systematic Consistency to Hero Section and Card Layout exercises
    **Flexbox:** built first Navbar by Flexbox, understood 'justify-content' and 'align-items' clearly
